# üì± Login and Sign-Up App

A robust and secure login and sign-up app that integrates REST API using Retrofit. Users can register by filling in their email details or by signing up directly via Google, Apple, or Facebook. The app also allows users to input business details, upload verification documents, and select operational dates for their shops.

> **Note**: This is an internship assignment project. The portrait UI was initially provided by **Software Lab**, and I have enhanced it with additional modifications, including full landscape mode support, along with implementing the complete code.
## üìù Project Overview

The **Login and Sign-Up App** provides a seamless user authentication system with persistent login functionality. Users can either sign in using their credentials or sign up through various methods such as Google, Apple, and Facebook. Once signed up, users can input business information, upload a business verification document, and select the dates when their shop is operational. All this data is securely sent and stored on a server using a REST API via Retrofit.
